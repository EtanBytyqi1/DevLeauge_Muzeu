                <p style="color:white;font-weight: bold; text-align: left; ">The National Museum of Kosovo was founded in 1949, while the building with Austro-Hungarian architecture dates back to 1885/6. It aims to preserve, protect and present the Cultural Heritage of Kosovo. The Museum of Kosovo includes a collection, with more than 50 thousand exhibits of different profiles, from the pavilion of archaeology, technology, history, nature, ento-culture, folklore, heritage, etc. Currently, the museum is engaged in the return of 1200 objects/artifacts important to the cultural heritage of Kosovo, taken from Belgrade during 1998. The Museum of Kosovo is located on Nazim Gafurri street. Founded in 1949, the Museum of Kosovo has departments of archaeology, ethnography and natural science, to which a department for the study of history and the National Liberation War was added in 1959. It has been active in sponsoring archaeological, conservation and scientific excavations of other work. Since 1956, it has published an annual magazine called "Bulletin of the Museum of Kosovo", with articles in Albanian (with summaries in French, English or German). The general museum consists of three parts of the museum: the Museum of Kosovo itself, the Housing Complex of Emin Gjik, where the ethnological exhibition is presented, and the Museum of Independence. The museum consists of four sectors, the archaeological sector, the ethnological sector, the historical sector and the natural sector. The main building of the museum consists of 3 halls or galleries, and one of them serves as a hall for permanent archaeological exhibitions, but various exhibitions are also presented in the inner courtyard of the museum, as well as in the lapidarium, namely in the Archaeological Park, which is located next to the museum building, or on the right side of it. In the cellars of the museum there are warehouses of thousands of finds, artifacts and mobile fragments of archaeological material, systematized and kept in special conditions with special attention and care. Finally, it should be noted that inside the building of the Museum of Kosovo, namely on the third floor, you can find the work environment of the Archaeological Institute of Kosovo, a scientific-professional institution responsible for archaeological research.</p>
